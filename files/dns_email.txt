Hi {INSERT CLIENT},
One important step in a web development project is to effectively manage where your domain (e.g. www.yoursite.com) points. Failure to plan for this can result in timing and propagation delays.
To avoid any delays, our hosting environments utilize a name based DNS, which allows us to point your domain at your current server up until the exact moment youâ€™re ready to go live.
 
To get started, we ask you to update your DNS accordingly:
 
example.com (non-www version) A record to 34.210.3.109
example.com (non-www version) A record to 35.166.147.204
www.example.com (www version) CNAME record to hosting.drud.com
 
Once updated, you will want to verify that this has been done correctly by using the following tools to check DNS records:
 
 
Check CNAME: http://mxtoolbox.com/CNAMELookup.aspx (input "www.example.com")
Check A record: http://www.mxtoolbox.com/DNSLookup.aspx (input "example.com")
 
Please note that some DNS changes can take up to anywhere from 24-48 hours to propagate.
Thanks,
{INSERT NAME}
